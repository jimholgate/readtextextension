Language editing
===============

- [PoEdit][1] is an open source language string editor for Linux, OSX, and
Windows.
- [Virtaal][2] is another one.

The format of **PO** translation files is described in the [PO Files Manual][3].
Having separate language files is best practice because it makes translating
easier and forces programs to have a single reliable method of getting text.
GetText is available in [Python][4] as a library. The [Invent with Python][5]
blog has a set of instructions.

In [StarBasic][6], there is a script that does basic interpretation of PO files.

The wording of dialogues and menu items of LibreOffice and Apache OpenOffice
include a few differences, which reflect different program features or simply
different writing styles.  If you notice a difference in your language, you
should, if possible, use wording that works for either program.

LibreOffice help is available online on a [wiki][7] that reflects the menus
and dialogues of a recent version of the program.  As well, a comprehensive file
that includes translations of phrases for all supported languages is maintained
at the [download site][8].

The `zzy` language is used internally in the code of the extension.  For
example, the phrase for "English" is `en`, and the code for "Traditional
Chinese" is `zh-tw`.
